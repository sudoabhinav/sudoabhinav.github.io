Currently working as a Software Engineer at [Lambdatest] (https://www.lambdatest.com/) and have close to 3 years of commercial software development experience.

I am a hard working, self taught programmer and the opportunity to work is all I look forward to and success will follow is what I believe.

During my professional experience I have worked with product companies in pharmacovigilance and testing domains. I speak binary with Golang, Python, SQL and also have worked in web development and Machine Learning sprints.

During my time at graduate school I got the opportunity to research and publish “[Get-a-doc : A Doctor Recommender System]” (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8748776), which highlights the improvement to online health consultation
applications in India.
