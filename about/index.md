I'm a student at Jaypee Institute of Information Technology Noida, pursuing my Bachelor of Engineering from the field of computer science. I have a passion for coding and have been actively involved in participating in various competitive programming contests to hone my skills.
My stint with web development is not recent, and I've been involved in the development of enterprise software in my interships with software development organizations.I've worked with Django, python scripting, jQuery and ajax.
