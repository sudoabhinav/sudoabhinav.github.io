I am currently working as a Software Engineer at [Credgenics] (https://credgenics.com/), with close to 6 years of hands-on experience in commercial software development.

I'm a self-taught, dedicated programmer who believes that if you're given the opportunity to work, success will naturally follow. I thrive on solving real-world problems with clean, efficient code.

Over the years, I've contributed to product teams across finance, pharmacovigilance, and testing domains. I’m fluent in Golang, Python, SQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, and have worked across web development stacks and Machine Learning projects.

During my time at graduate school I got the opportunity to research and publish “[Get-a-doc : A Doctor Recommender System]” (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8748776), which highlights the improvement to online health consultation
applications in India.
