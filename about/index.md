I'm an avid learner and ensure working on improving my skills set around machine learning, Python, leveraging udemy/coursera in the process. I also regularly participate in coding competitions or do practice problems available on platforms like Hackerank / CodeChef.

I worked with [STMicroelectronics](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en.html) & more, during my internship. where in I have used [Python](https://python.org) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) to build and maintain web applications.
